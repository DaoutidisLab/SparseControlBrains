# Internal Control of Brains Networks via Sparse Feedback

This repository has the code necessary to generate the results in the following paper:

Mitrai, I., Jones, V., Dewantoro, H., Stamoulis, C., Daoutidis P., Internal control of brain networks via Sparse feedback

The repository has three Matlab files:

 - analyze_structural_network_final_code.m: This file solves the Sparsity promoting optimal controller Synthesis problem for the structurak brain networks
 - analyze_functional_network.m: This file solves the Sparsity promoting optimal controller Synthesis problem for the functional brain networks


This code requires the following data and packages:

Data: 
- [Structural brain networks](https://complexsystemsupenn.com/s/NCTfMRI30SubScale60_ROI_volcorrected.mat) 

Software:
- [LQRSP â€“ Sparsity-Promoting Linear Quadratic Regulator](http://www.ece.umn.edu/users/mihailo/software/lqrsp/)
